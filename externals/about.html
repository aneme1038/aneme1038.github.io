        Hi, I'm Aaron Neme. Thanks for taking the time to read more about who I am and what makes me tick. To start off, I am in my mid-30's and having recently graduated from both Rochester University and General Assembly. I graduated Summa Cum Laude, earning my bachelor’s degree in Christian Ministry as well as a certificate in Software Engineering from General Assembly. A long-term goal of mine is to earn a Master’s Degree.
        <br />
        My foray into software development has brought about a plethora of skills and knowledge in many different languages and frameworks. Because of this, I have an excellent foundation in full-stack development and bring those skills to you, the client. By hiring me, you are hiring honesty, integrity, loyalty, and a humble mind that seeks to grow and adapt to your needs.
        <br />
        My faith has been a big part of my life and it is something that ultimately influences what I do and how I treat those I work with. It has helped guide me in tough and difficult situations where no answer was in sight. The skills learned and the intelligence gained in development is all in an effort to help create programs, apps, and software that will help benefit those in need. In particular, I have a vested interest in developing and creating software solutions that helps serve the poor, widowed, broken, orphan, or lowly.
        <br />
        A comprehensive list of languages and frameworks is viewable on my Resume. Should you choose to hire me, I will work to faithfully and with integrity work to solve your issues and address your needs, be it big or small.
