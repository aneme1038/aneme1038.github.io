            <p>Wed-Ly is a project currently under development but visible to the public during its development process. Currently, the main purpose behind the application is to learn a completely new language, framework, or methodology. I chose VueJS as the language to learn for this specific project. The project currently features a basic checklist where a person can view and delete entries. The aim is to get full CRUD capability and continue to add features as is needed to improve the application</p>
