Instructions
------------
The game features a slew of buttons for user control. An explanation for each button is as follows:
  Instructions: Displays a modal detailing what the user needs to know to correctly operate the game. A close link is provided in the modal upon the user having finished read the instructions.
  Start Game: This button will start the Game. However, it must be noted that this button will not be enabled or clickable until the user selects a game difficulty.
  Question Button: This button is designed to allow the user to display the next question to answer.
  Submit Button: Upon selecting an answer, the user must submit their answer. NOTE: Only ONE answer can be submitted. Please do not click the "Submit" Button more than once. Please ensure you have the correct choice before clicking submit!
  DIFFICULTY
  =--------=
  Each difficulty (Easy, Medium, and Hard) will contain 30 questions for the user to answer. There are three buttons corresponding to the difficulty the user wishes to start the game in. When a difficulty button is selected, it will simply display the text "Selected". This will ensure that the difficulty is locked in. If the user wishes to select a different difficulty, all they are required to do is select a different difficulty. Or they may wish to de-select the current difficulty, which is also allowable.
  
  The trivia application features a question counter that will display the user's current question in the trivia game. Once the user answers 30 questions, the user will be presented with a modal that displays the user's results.
  
  If the user wishes to reset the game to try a different difficulty, they can do so at any time.
